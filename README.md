# Henry Vendittelli Next.js Portfolio

</div>

I wanted to upgrade my old crappy React portfolio, to one that uses Next.js, tailwind, typescript.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) portfolio bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Details

- Hero/Home/Henry section.
- About me.
- Projects.
- Contact.

Things to add:

- About: Most recent listened to music using lastfm, espresso, keyboards, cd list, clubs.
- Projects: (QMIND, BEAR, RentalDB, QUANTT)
- Contact: Resume preview.

## Setup

Install packages:

```
npm install
```

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

This portfolio uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
