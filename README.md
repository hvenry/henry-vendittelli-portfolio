## About

Welcome to my portfolio website! This site is a showcase of my work, skills, and projects built from the ground up. This site was iteratively prototyped, with constant feedback from peers and professionals in the industry.

## Technology Stack

- **Next.js**: A framework that handles React config, many optimizations, and also enables server-side rendering.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety.
- **Tailwind CSS**: I just personally love tailwind over regular CSS.

## Hosting

- **Vercel**: The site is hosted on Vercel, which offers seamless integration with Next.js, automatic HTTPS, and a serverless architecture. Vercel was chosen for its performance, scalability, and zero cost.

## Key Features

- **Light and Dark Modes:** To enhance accessibility and provide a comfortable viewing experience, the website includes both light and dark themes, allowing users to switch based on their preference.
- **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts seamlessly to any device, whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone, ensuring a consistent and optimized user experience.
- **Attention to Detail:** Every element of the site reflects my commitment to quality, from the smooth transitions to the thoughtfully chosen color schemes and typography.
